                So with our goal to strengthen the local community and economy,
                part of our platform is Events, where artists can create and
                manage event listings to facilitate connections between other
                locals and grow the local art community. Here on our events
                page, people will be able to see a list of events offered by the
                artists on our site.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="color: red"> [Click on a single event] </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                They'll be able to visit the page for an event, to see more
                information about it, sign up for it
                <span style="color: red"> [Click on Attend Event] </span> and
                also message the artist with any questions they have. When they
                choose to attend an event, they will then receive an email
                confirming their attendance and if details about the event
                change.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="color: red"> [Click Shop Page] </span>
            </p>
            <p>Artists are also able to sell their products on Versa. On our
                shop page, customers will be shown the products offered,
                including a spotlight section where we will highlight one
                artist's products each month
            </p>
            <p>
                On the product page, our customers will be able to add items to
                their cart choosing from the various sizes and colours that the
                artist has offered
                <span style="color: red"> [Click on Add To Cart] </span>. They
                can buy with confidence, knowing that the products are locally
                sourced, handmade and can be delivered the same day.
            </p>
            <p><span style="color: red">[Click on Cart]</span></p>
            <p>
                Once a customer has found all that they are interested in
                buying, they can visit their cart and checkout. When they
                complete their purchase, they'll receive an email with their
                order details.
            </p>

                >
            </p>
            <p>
                Our users will also be able to manage the purchases they make
                and events they have signed up from from their dashboard. Here
                they will also be able to check for replies to the messages they
                sent to artists. In the future they will be able to leave
                feedback and reviews on products and events to help artists see
                how they can improve their products and to help customers make
                more informed purchases.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that we've covered some the features that customers will
                have on our site, we can move on to some of the features for our
                artist users.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="color: red">[Click on Artist in Side Menu]</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the dashboard, users can click on their user type to get
                features specific to them. For example, artists will have
                inventory management, so they can easily manage how much of each
                of their items they have still available.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="color: red"
                    >[Click on Analytics, close side Menu]</span
                >
            </p>
            <p>
                Another feature we offer to our artist users is analytics about
                their sales. Here they will be able to get helpful information
                about their sales on Versa, including details about which
                products are selling the best, and how their sales change over
                time.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="color: red"
                    >[Open Side Nav, Click on Orders, close side Menu]</span
                >
            </p>
            <p>
                When a customer makes a purchase that includes the artists
                products, the artist will be able to visit their orders page to
                see a list of orders they have to prepare to ship out. Clicking
                on a single order
                <span style="color: red">[Click on single order]</span>
                will give them information about which products to include, as
                well as the ability to message the customer for anything extra
                they might need to know.
            </p>
            <span style="color: red"
                >[Open Side Nav, Click on Messages, close Side Nav]</span
            >
            <p>
                Our messaging system makes it easy for artists to provide
                exceptional customer service and manage their relationship with
                customers, with the ability to search for messages they've
                received about products, events and orders, and reply to them.
            </p>
            <span style="color: red">[Open side nav, click Driver Tab]</span>
            <p>
                The third type of user on our platform, drivers, also have
                several features that will help them in delivering artist's
                products.
            </p>
            <span style="color: red">[Click on Pickups, close side Nav]</span>
            <p>
                Drivers on Versa will have the flexibility to work part time and
                fulfill one order at a time or do batch pickup and deliveries as
                a full time employee.
            </p>
            <p>
                From here, drivers will be able to see the artists that have
                products ready to deliver. Choosing one of the artists
                <span style="color: red"
                    >[Click on one of the pickup buttons]</span
                >will bring them to this page where they will see what products
                are ready to be picked up. Once they have picked the items up,
                they can mark them as picked up.
            </p>
            <span style="color: red"
                >[Open side Nav, click deliveries, close side nav]</span
            >
            <p>
                Once the driver has picked up items from the artist, they will
                be able to see orders that are ready for them to deliver. Here
                when they are ready to start delivering, they can click start
                delivery
                <span style="color: red"
                    >[Click on start delivery, close side Menu]</span
                >
                which will give them directions to the customer's address.
                Completing that,
                <span style="color: red">[Change tabs back to Versa]</span> they
                will come back to the deliveries page and set the order as
                delivered
                <span style="color: red">[Click on Set Item As Delivered]</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now I'll leave it to Messele to talk about the technologies we
                used in creating our platform.
